    "Generative Pretrained Transformer, also known as GPT, has demonstrated significant success in different language problems. GPT is a transformer-based generative model for language modeling task. Despite being trained only on language modeling task, GPT's capability can [extend beyond the the language modeling scope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) to perform well on almost any language task. Furthermore, researchers found that as the model and data size increase, the GPT model is observed to gain foundational understanding of human language, such that any downstream language task can be achieved with little to no extra training. This finding has started a new \"gold rush\" in the field of AI - the pursuit of foundation model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this apphub, we will implement GPT model in FastEstiamtor using PyTorch backend. We will showcase the building blocks of GPT, along with its training details. The model we'll be training in this example won't be a billion or trillion parameter model, but with a slight adjustment of model parameters, our code base can be used to produce billion-parameter large language models with state-of-the-art performance."

    "AI model deals with numbers, not text. Therefore, we need a special process to convert text into number, and this is called `tokenization`. Tokenization can take place in many levels: character level, word level, sentence level, and so on.  The most popular approach used by current large language model is the word level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive way of doing word-level tokenization is to simply store vocabulary of all possible words, and perform a mapping between possible word to index. However, the limitation of word mapping is that there are many out-of-vocabulary words people customize to express specific meanings, which makes it almost impossible for pre-defined vocabulary to capture all the words. For example the word `FastEstimator` technically doesn't exist in English, but we all know what it means. :) \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the above challenge, people created sub-word tokenization. This is more consistent with how english grammar works and it can significantly reduce the chance of encountering unknown words. More importantly, this also increases the reusability of tokens and reduce the problem space quite well.\n",
    "\n",
